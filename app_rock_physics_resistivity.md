## Interactive App

From elecgtromagnetic (EM) imaging, we can obtain an image of the subsurface resistivity. 
While resistivity provides useful information about the subsurface hydrogeology, it is very challenging to determine
hydrogeology just from resistivity. Therefore, there is a need to correlate resistivity from EM geophysics to hydrogeology. 
This app focuses on building relationship between

## Usage

### App Parameters

- `Colocation Distance`: resistivity of the fine-dominated
- `Approach`: `interval` or `integral`
