This app demonstrates an impact of a threshold value of fraction coarse dominated (FCD) on four different recharge metric maps, which are the final outputs of the [fastpath-app](https://fastpath-app.stanford.edu).

To launch the compute server used to run this app, click on the power button on the upper right hand corner of the application pane. After a moment, the icon will be replaced with three new icons. The filled in lightning bolt indicates that the application is displaying its default settings. Click the play button to run the application (this will enable you to change values, and interact with the figures). Note that after clicking the play button, the lightning bolt will only show and outline, indicating the figures displayed may not be the defaults. Finally, click the return arrow if you would like to reset the app to its default settings.
