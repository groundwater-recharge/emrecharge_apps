# Interactive Educational Applications

We have developed interactive educational apps to complement the use of our web application, [fastpath](https://fastpath.stanford.edu). Our fastpath app utilizes publicly available geophysical data acquired through electromagnetic (EM) imaging, along with auxiliary in-situ data, such as sediment type information obtained from drillings.

These combined datasets enable the creation of 2D maps showcasing recharge metrics, providing valuable guidance for determining optimal recharge site locations. To help users make the most of our fastpath app, we offer a series of interactive apps designed to enhance their understanding of the underlying processes.

## EM Imaging Apps

EM Imaging Apps are dedicated to explaining the fundamentals of EM imaging. Users can explore how this geophysical technique works and how it facilitates the acquisition of essential data for recharge site analysis.

## Rock Physics Apps

Rock Physics Apps focuse on the rock physics transform, which involves the conversion of resistivity data to sediment type information. Users can gain insights into the complex process of translating geophysical data into meaningful geological characteristics, aiding in the assessment of potential recharge sites.

## Recharge Metrics App

The final interactive app leads users through the process of creating comprehensive maps of recharge metrics. By combining the EM imaging data and the rock physics transform results, users can obtain a clearer picture of the most suitable areas for recharge, maximizing the effectiveness of their decisions.
