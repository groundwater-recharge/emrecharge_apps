# Interactive Educational Applications

We have developed interactive educational apps to complement our online course, Harnessing the Power of Geophysics to Recharge California’s Groundwater. Our [fastpath app](https://fastpath-app.stanford.edu)utilizes publicly available geophysical data acquired through electromagnetic (EM) imaging, along with auxiliary in-situ data, such as sediment type information obtained from drillings.

These combined datasets enable the creation of 2D maps showcasing recharge metrics, providing valuable guidance for determining optimal recharge site locations. To help users make the most of our fastpath app, we offer a series of interactive apps designed to enhance their understanding of the underlying processes.

Without the background and guide lines provided in the online course, simply interacting with the educational apps for building your understanding about the fastpatha app is NOT RECOMMENDED!

## EM Imaging Apps

The EM Imaging Apps are designed to allow users to explore some of the fundamental concepts of EM imaging. Users can explore how this geophysical technique works and how it facilitates the acquisition of essential data for recharge site analysis.

## Rock Physics Apps

The Rock Physics Apps focus on the Stanford Environmental Geophysics Group’s approach to the rock physics transform, which involves the conversion of resistivity data to sediment type information. Users can gain insights into the complex process of translating geophysical data into meaningful geological characteristics, aiding in the assessment of potential recharge sites.

## Recharge Metrics App

The final interactive app leads users through the process of creating recharge metric maps. By combining the EM imaging data and the rock physics transform results, users can obtain a clearer picture of the most suitable areas for recharge, maximizing the effectiveness of their decisions.

Through these interactive educational apps, we aim to empower users with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use our fastpath web application. These apps are intended to be used within our online course, where the concepts behind each of them are explained in detail, and users are guided through targeted exercises. By understanding the principles and processes behind the Fastpath tool, users can confidently identify and evaluate recharge site locations, contributing to more successful groundwater management and environmental conservation efforts.
